#Step 4 & Step 5
#Using SQL join the studentAssessment and studentInfo tables by the id_student variable.
#Create a summary of the mean score, summarized according to region.

SELECT b.region,
ROUND(AVG(a.score),2) as mean_score
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentAssessment` a
JOIN `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo` b
ON a.id_student = b.id_student
GROUP BY b.region;


#Step 6
#Select all students from the studentInfo table who live in a region that has a name where the letter 'c' is the second letter

SELECT *
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo`
WHERE region LIKE "_c%";

#Step 7 - Any interesting investigation
