#Step 4 & Step 5
#Using SQL join the studentAssessment and studentInfo tables by the id_student variable.
#Create a summary of the mean score, summarized according to region.

SELECT b.region,
ROUND(AVG(a.score),2) as mean_score
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentAssessment` a
JOIN `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo` b
ON a.id_student = b.id_student
GROUP BY b.region;


#Step 6
#Select all students from the studentInfo table who live in a region that has a name where the letter 'c' is the second letter

SELECT *
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo`
WHERE region LIKE "_c%";

#Step 7 - Any interesting investigation

#7.1 Find the number of withdrawn registration per region

select region,
COUNT(final_result) as Number_of_Withdrawn,
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo`
WHERE final_result = "Withdrawn"
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY Number_of_Withdrawn DESC; 


#7.2 Find the number of students passing different assessments type in different semester
 
SELECT b.code_presentation,
b.assessment_type,
COUNT(a.score) AS pass,
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentAssessment` a
JOIN `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.assessments` b
ON a.id_assessment = b.id_assessment
WHERE a.score >= 40
GROUP BY b.code_presentation, b.assessment_type
ORDER BY b.code_presentation, pass DESC;

#7.3 Find the average number of times a students interacts with the material in region contains "u"
SELECT a.code_presentation,
ROUND(AVG(sum_click),2) as Average_SumClick
FROM `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentVle` a
JOIN `teacherscollege-casestudy.OULA_dataset.studentInfo` b
ON a.id_student = b.id_student
